Modules should be things along the likes of: search-box, dialog, navigation, menu, content-box. Submodules are more specific versions of these modules such as:  dialog-wide, navigation-tabbed, menu-dropdown. The ideal module is completely independent of its context and should work within any layout container or other module. If a specific context requires changes to a module you rather create a submodule that describes the context, instead changing styles based on the parent (e.g. .content-box-narrow instead of #sidebar .content-box).
